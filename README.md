# 👋🏻, hello folks

I configured my readme with Yet Another Markup File **`readme.yml`**:

```yml
- name: heman sakkthivel 
  url: https://github.com
  color: '#BC9689 (💁🏻 indian)'

  projects:
      - url: https://github.com/hm4n?tab=repositories

  about me: I'm an indie full stack developer and opensource enthu, having fun with functional programming paradigm
            and system level programming as a `Rustacean 👾`. I'd like to flex with my fellow developers with my mac
            and shity stickers on it😗.

  tools:
      -text editor: obviously vim over emacs 😏, XCode, Postman and VSCode
```
